# Quicksort Algorithm

## How it works

Choose a Pivot: Select an element from the array as the pivot.

Partitioning: Use while loops to rearrange elements so that all elements less than the pivot come before it, and all elements greater than the pivot come after it.

Recursively Apply: Use a stack to iteratively process the sub-arrays formed by partitioning.

Combine: Combine the sub-arrays to form the sorted array.
