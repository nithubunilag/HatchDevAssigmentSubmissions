# My Submission

## Main Projects

**Project 1: Address Book System.**
- Implement an address book system using **OOP** principles. Each contact should be represented as an object with attributes like name, phone number, and address. Demonstrate inheritance and encapsulation in your implementation.

**Project 2: Online Shopping System**
- Design and implement a simple online shopping system. Use interfaces for different types of products, and demonstrate composition and aggregation for the shopping cart. Apply SOLID principles in your design.

**Project 3: Simple Task Manager**
- Create a basic task manager that uses arrays and linked lists to store and manage tasks. Implement features like adding, deleting, and displaying tasks. Practice algorithmic techniques for task manipulation.

**Project 4: Playlist Management System**
- Develop a playlist management system that utilizes arrays for quick access to song metadata and linked lists for managing the sequence of songs in a playlist. Implement features like adding, removing, and shuffling songs.
