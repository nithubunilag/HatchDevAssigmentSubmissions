# Quicksort 

Quicksort is a method used to sort an array by dividing it into smaller parts. It picks one element as a 'pivot' and arranges the other elements into two groups: those less than the pivot and those greater. These groups are then sorted in the same way. This process uses little extra memory.

Quicksort compares elements to sort them, meaning it can handle any type of item as long as they can be compared. However, it usually doesn't keep the order of equal items.

On average, quicksort takes
