# What is Quick Sort?

Quick sort is a sorting algorithm that employs a "divide and conquer" methodology. It works by sorting an array of items around an element of the array, known as the pivot.
All items in the array lesser than the pivot element is moved to the left of the pivot and items greater than the pivot are moved to the right of the array. This is called partitioning of the array.
This partitioning is then performed on the sub arrays on the right and left with their pivot elements.
This process is repeated until both sub arrays are sorted and then they are merged together.
