# Insertion sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with equal values maintain their relative order in the sorted output.

Insertion sort is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

# Selection sort
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the sorted portion of the list. 
The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process is repeated for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire list is sorted. 

# Bubble sort
Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

In Bubble Sort algorithm, 

1. traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
2. In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
3. This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.
