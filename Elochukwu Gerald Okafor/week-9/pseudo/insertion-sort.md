## Insertion Sort Pseudo Code

Pseudo code for an iterative implementation of insertion sort.

1. START
2. Receive an array as the input
3. Initialize a variable n to the length of the array
4. FOR i from 1 to n-1
5. Set key to the element at index i
6. Initialize a variable j to i - 1
7. WHILE j >= 0 and the element at index j is greater than key
8. Move the element at index j to index j + 1
9. Decrement j by 1
10. Insert key at index j + 1
11. END
