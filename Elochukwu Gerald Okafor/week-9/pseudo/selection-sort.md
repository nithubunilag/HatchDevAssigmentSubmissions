## Selection Sort Pseudo Code

Pseudo code for iterative selection sort algorithm. Works by initially assuming the first element already sorted, then iteratively selecting the minimum element

1. START
2. Iterate over each element in the array
3. Iterate again (nested) over the elements after the current element
4. Compare each element with the current element
5. If the current element is greater than the nested current element, swap their positions
6. Else, continue
7. Repeat for the other elements
8. END
