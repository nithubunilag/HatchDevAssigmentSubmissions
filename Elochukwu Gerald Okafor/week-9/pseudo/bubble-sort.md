## Bubble Sort Pseudo Code

Pseudo code for an iterative implementation of bubble sort.

1. START
2. Receive an array as the input
3. Initialize a variable n to the length of the array
4. Initialize a variable swapped to true
5. WHILE swapped is true
    6. Set swapped to false
    7. Iterate from i = 0 to n-2
       1. In each iteration, check if the element at index i is greater than the element at index i+1
       2. If true, swap elements at i and i+1
8. Set swapped to true
9. END
