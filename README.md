For the quick sort algoritm, we use a pivot as our base condition
A pivot is an element in the array, we use that element to compare with others
Using the last element as our pivot, we iterate through the array, taking element lesser than the pivot to a left array and elements greater than the pivot to a right array.
Next we recursively check the left array and carry out the same process, same with the right array
When we finally get an empty array.
We spread all the array together till we get to the first pivot array
